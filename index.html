    <h2>How to set up Visual Studio Code</h2>

    <p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To get started with Visual Studio Code (VS), you'll need to first download it depending on your make of computer. Then, in your file manager, make a new folder and name it something that you can identify as Visual Studio. This is where you will save all of your VS projects and creations. To begin a project, open your file manager, navigate to your Visual Studio folder, create a new file, and name it whatever you like. After that, you'll open your Visual Studio app and open the new file you just prepared to begin writing code. You must first create a new file named index.hmtl within this one. Once you've completed this, you're ready to begin coding and design whatever you want!

<h2>
Console Log
</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The console log can be used to output any type of variable or any message that needs to be displayed to the user. It's a place where the code may be double-checked to make sure it's working before it's finished and distributed. In order to show something on the console screen, you must use the JavaScript function console.log(), then insert whatever information you want to display on the console screen inside the rounded brackets. <br> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to open the console log on any webpage, simply right click, then choose the option to inspect at the very bottom. Once you have done this, a panel will appear on your screen. Look to the top of the panel and there should be multiple tabs labeled Elements, Console, Sources, Network, etc. The second option is a tab labeled console. Click on this option, and it will take you to the console screen where you should be able to see all that you have chosen to display there.
